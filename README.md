# NeuralRegressorHouseValue
This GitHub repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks that illustrate how to predict Boston housing prices using
both regression techniques and Neural Networks. The goal of this project is to provide a practical example for
understanding the basics of machine learning, specifically focusing on regression tasks.

## Contents
- `Regression.ipynb`: This notebook uses various regression techniques to predict
Boston housing prices. It includes data loading and preprocessing steps, feature selection, model training,
validation, and prediction.

- `Neural_Networks.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates the use of Neural Networks
(specifically a type of deep learning known as Artificial Neural Network) for predicting Boston housing prices in
a similar manner. It also includes data loading and preprocessing steps, model training, validation, and
prediction.

## Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local environment. Open the notebooks with Jupyter Notebook or Google
Colab and follow along with the instructions. Ensure that you have installed all required Python packages (numpy,
pandas, sklearn, keras etc.) before running the code.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Boston Housing dataset which contains information collected by the U.S
Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass. The details about the dataset and how it can be
obtained are available on [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing).
Dataset used for this project is also provided in the repository if needed.

## Limitations
While these notebooks illustrate how machine learning techniques (regression & Neural Networks) can be used
in regression tasks, the accuracy of predictions is ultimately limited by the complexity and variability of
real-world data. The results should not be directly used for investment decisions or other forms of financial
advice.

Always use these models responsibly and ensure to consider their limitations before using them for making real
estate investments.
